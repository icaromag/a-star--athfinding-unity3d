# Adaptative Weighted Pathfinding in Urban Environments

Computational modeling and simulations in dynamic urban environments are complex problems that require significant amounts of resources.
This project brings an interactive adaptative pathfinding simulation tool that can be executed in real time and used within the Unity 3D Game Engine.

My neighborhood's map was digitalized using Blender to create a heightmap that is used to test the solution

Here we can see vehicles avoiding or not the red zone based on weight applied

The streets are represented represented as a matrix / graph

Different weights are applied all over the map's surface
